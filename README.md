This is the source code behind [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com).

The      idea       of      this       service      is       inspired      from
[rawgithub.com](http://rawgithub.com).  I  just  realized that  using  a  whole
framework (node.js + express.js) for such  simple thing as requests proxying is
overkilling, and made same stuff using nginx only.
