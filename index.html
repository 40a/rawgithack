        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p>
        You've got a <code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code> URL that points to some work-in-progress HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. You'd like to share it with someone for a quick demo, or maybe you'd like to use it in a <a href="http://jsperf.com/">jsPerf</a> test.
        </p>

        <p>
        Too bad! Most things served from <code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code> have a <code>text/plain</code> content type and are served with an <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> header, which means HTML won't render, and some browsers won't execute JavaScript or apply CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>
        Change the domain! Just replace <code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code> with <code>raw.githack.com</code> and <em>skadoosh</em>, you're loading raw files from your GitHub repo and they're served with appropriate content types. Render HTML, apply CSS, execute JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Before</strong></p>
        <pre class="before">https://raw.<strong>githubusercontent</strong>.com/user/repo/master/filename.js</pre>

        <p><strong>After</strong></p>
        <pre class="after">https://raw.<strong>githack</strong>.com/user/repo/master/filename.js</pre>

        <p>
        It works with gists too! Just replace <code>gist.githubusercontent.com</code> with <code>gist.githack.com</code> in the raw gist URL.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>NEW!</strong>
        Now it works even with bitbucket! You simply need to replace <code>bitbucket.org</code> with <code>bb.githack.com</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>The Caveat</h2>

        <p>
        Use this for testing and for sharing demo code with friends, but <strong>don't use it for anything production-related</strong>. It's slow, it might break from time to time, and it's intended as a convenience for development, not free static hosting.
        </p>

        <h2>The Source</h2>

        <p>
        The source code for raw.githack.com is <a href="https://github.com/neoascetic/rawgithack">hosted on GitHub</a>! Fork it and go nuts.
        </p>

        <h2>The FAQ</h2>

        <h3 id="can-i-use-raw-githack-com-in-production"><a href="#can-i-use-raw-githack-com-in-production">Can I use raw.githack.com on a production website?</a></h3>

        <p>
        No. Don't do this. Not even a little bit. It will make me very sad.
        </p>

        <p>
        raw.githack.com is a free service to make developers' lives easier when developing and testing and debugging things. It's not free hosting. Use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for that.
        </p>

        <h3 id="what-will-happen-if-im-an-asshole"><a href="#what-will-happen-if-im-an-asshole">What will happen if I hotlink to a raw.githack.com URL on a production
            website?</a></h3>

        <p>
        Bad things. If you hotlink to a raw.githack.com URL on a site that gets lots of traffic, requests will be throttled. If this heavy traffic continues, requests originating from your site will eventually be dropped.
        </p>

        <p>
        We can't always get what we want. You should use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which is designed for that. Also that's not a question.

        Hey! raw.githack.com is just for fun and is not associated with GitHub in any way. Please use it responsibly. Have feedback? I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/neoascetic">@neoascetic</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        The idea of this service is inspired from <a href="http://rawgithub.com">rawgithub.com</a>. I just realized that using a whole framework (node.js + express.js) for such simple thing as requests proxying is overkilling, and made same stuff using nginx only.
