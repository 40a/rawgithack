===============

This is the source code behind <http://raw.githack.com/>.

The idea of this service inspired from [rawgithub.com](http://rawgithub.com/).
I just realized that using a whole framework (node.js + express.js) for such
simple thing as requests proxying is overkilling, and made same stuff using
nginx only.
